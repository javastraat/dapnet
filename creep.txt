you are mine.
You shall not pass.
You cannot harm us.
You cannot harm me.
Who disturbs our rest?
Who disturbs my rest?
What is dead cannot die.
We are coming for you.
Your will is no longer your own.
We will bury you.
We have awaken.
We are watching you.
We are immortal.
We are eternal.
Tremble mortal.
You are one of us now.
You are safe with us now.
The path is closed.
The past haunts you.
The pain.
Suffering.
Run.
Release us.
Release me.
Pathetic mortal.
Mercy.
Meet your fate.
Look at me.
Let us rest.
Let me rest.
Let us out.
Let me out.
Leave us.
Join us in death.
Join me in death.
Join me.
It is cold.
It is ours.
Intruder.
I am coming for you. 
I will feed on your soul.
I will protect you.
I will bury you.
I know what youve done.
I have awaken.
I feel you.
I am watching you.
I am immortal.
I am eternal.
I am banished.
Help us.
Help me.
Hear our voice.
Hear my voice.
Free us.
Free me.
Forgive us.
Forgive me.
Doom awaits you. 
Die.
Death.
Darkness consume you.
Curse upon you.
Command us.
Command me.
Come inside, mortal.
Can you hear us.
Can you hear me.
Avenge us.
Avenge me.
Go away.
Leave this place.
Stay out, mortal.
Can you see.
Lay down in our grave.
Destiny awaits.
Disperse into nothingness.
Descend into oblivion.
Come to me. 
Follow the light.
This is the place of the dead.
We sense the living.
I sense the living.
We can see you.
I can see you.
Visitor.
A mortal approaches.
Whos there?
Who enters my tomb?
This place is cursed.
This place is mine.
Are you scared?
Let the cold embrace you.
The nightmare begins.
